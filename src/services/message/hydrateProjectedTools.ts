 * — a document loses its text and XML, a command its stdout, a crawl its page —
 * so restoring only the body would still hand a lossy row to an export that
 * calls itself lossless.
 *
 * Failures are reported rather than thrown: a resume replay would rather ship a
 * degraded transcript than lose the user's prompt, while an export must refuse
 * to serialize. `missing` lets each caller pick.
