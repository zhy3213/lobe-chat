   * `hydrate` / `replace` explicitly, because the replica reads the *active*
   * scope at call time — i.e. after the response has already landed. A response
   * that resolves after the scope moved on is then dropped by the replica
   * itself (`dispatch` discards actions whose scope is no longer active),
   * instead of being written into the next identity's partition.
   *
   * The whole cache scope (user + workspace) is captured, not just the
   * workspace: two different signed-in users in personal context both have a
   * `null` workspace, so a workspace-only guard cannot tell them apart and
   * would store user A's connector inventory in user B's partition after an

   * this covers — the tree mounts once in personal context before the URL→store
   * sync resolves the slug, so a personal `list` query is already in flight
   * when the workspace switch fires its own, and the personal one landing last
   * is what made a business workspace list the user's PERSONAL tools.
   *
   * Dropping the response is only half of it. A dropped response must not leave
   * the *previous* scope's hydration behind either: the persisted personal
   * projection can have painted (and set `isConnectorsInit`) during that same
   * personal window, and every consumer gates its fetch on that flag — so the
   * workspace would keep showing the personal inventory and never load its own.
   * `#dropStaleScope` clears the views the moment the scope moves (see the
   * `subscribeCacheScope` wiring in the constructor).
   *
   * No reset is needed here for the fetch itself: the engine folds the scope
   * reset into the same commit as the response, so a stale view can never be
   * replaced into — and doing it here would commit store state synchronously
   * before the caller's in-flight guard is up, which multiplies the requests a
