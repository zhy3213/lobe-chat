/**
 * Upgrade legacy project_working_directories rows into the environment model.
 *
 * A directory resolves through its natural key: the environment_instances row
 * for (device_id, path) whose environment is linked to the directory's project
 * via project_environments. A legacy row is one where that chain is missing.
 * For each one this:
 *   1. reuses the instance for (device_id, path), or creates it together with
 *      a minimal parent environment;
 *   2. links the project to that environment (project_environments).
 *
 * Rows whose device is gone (device_id NULL or dangling) can never execute —
 * ProjectWorkingDirectoryModel.resolve already rejects them — and are deleted.
 *
 * Idempotent: an upgraded row satisfies the natural-key chain and is no longer
 * selected; the id cursor keeps a dry run from revisiting rows.
 *
 * The cursor scan deliberately does NOT use `SKIP LOCKED`. Skipping a locked
 * row would still return later rows, so the cursor would advance past the
 * skipped one and the row would be stranded behind it — never upgraded, while
 * the run still reports completion. Waiting for the lock instead keeps the
 * scanned window gap-free, so the backfill always converges.
